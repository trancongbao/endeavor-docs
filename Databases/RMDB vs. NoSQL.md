There are a lots of many-to-many relationships.

- Words and Cards
- Students and Cards
- Students and Lessons
- Students and Courses
- Teachers and Courses
- etc.

Let's take `Words and Cards` as an example. In MongoDB, there are 2 ways you can do this.

- If you decide to go with `referencing` like in relational design, then for simply fetching words belong to a card 2 `lookup`s are needed and you still have problems with data integrity, since MongoDB doesnâ€™t support foreign keys.
- If you decide to go with `embedding` and storing words in a card document as an array, then getting words in a card (from a student perspective) will be faster, but getting list of cards that a word belongs to (from a teacher perspective) will be very slow. You can store word ids in a card document and card ids in a word document, but then we have duplication and we need to deal with update/delete anomalies.

So it's better to use a RMDB with `json`` support such as `PostgresSQL`.
